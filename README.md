## Introduction
This is a Facebook chat clone written using [EnyoJS](http://enyojs.com/).

Original Based on [xmpp-chat](https://github.com/szimek/xmpp-chat), which uses [Strophe.js](http://strophe.im/strophejs/) and [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js).

## Installation
The Test WebApp runs on a web server written in [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) that acts as a static test server for testing the application standalone. It requires `express` package. Run `node app.js` and it will start the server on port `9677`.

## Todo
- The WebApp needs to be able to be a widget that can be included on any site.
- Have an API or Modular communication layer for diffrent protocols (WebSockets, WebRTC, long-polling, XMPP) etc.
